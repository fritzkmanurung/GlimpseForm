## üíª Tech Stack

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | For the semantic structure of the form and its input fields. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

No complex installation or build process is required to use this component.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    <br>
    `git clone https://github.com/fritzkmanurung/GlimpseForm.git`

2.  **Open in Your Browser**
    Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see the form in action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use this component in your own project:

1.  **Copy the HTML**: Copy the relevant HTML structure from the `<body>` of the `index.html` file into your project.
2.  **Link the CSS**: Link the `style.css` file in the `<head>` of your HTML document.
3.  **Link the JavaScript**: Link the `script.js` file at the end of your `<body>` tag.
4.  **Customize**: Modify the form fields or validation logic in the JavaScript file to suit your needs. The form submission logic is simulated in the `submitFeedback` function; you can replace this with your own backend endpoint.
